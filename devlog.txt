- version 0.1 - only the basics you got the base website, the simple style and a movable square, and a lot of placeholders
		- if I feel like it tommorow I will do the shooting mechanic and make the background scroll with the players movement
- version 0.1.5 - Some improvement has been made. The player is no longer a square. You can shoot now even tho there is nothing to shoot
		- at. The sprite looks like shit but I will fix it. So stuff I want to get done is : enemies, a background, a good looking sprite
- version 0.2 - The enemies have arrived they are currently red squares with healthbars above them. A simple level progression has also been added
		- it doesnt really work. So stuff I want to get done is: a background, a good looking sprite, functionall level progression, sprites
		- for the enemies
- version 0.3 - The sprite is in a okay condition. I also added a pause menu and a main menu. A cheat console and some cheat codes have also been added
	      - The background is also done it looks ok not great but ok. Tbh I forgor what I did sooo yeah. So stuff I want to get done is: enemy sprites
	      - items, item store that randomly appears, maybe sound effects
- version 0.4 - I added a store and multiple ammo types. I also made the enemies taller. So they arent a square but a rectangle so it at least looks like 
		something vaguely humanoid I guess. Also some cheat codes for the purpose of easier testing maybe Ill leave them there. But I want to add
		multiple "stores" so when you defeat all enemies there is random chance on what establishment you can visit. The enemy sprites are still
		on the to-do list but I hate doing sprites so much so it will probably take untill before the game is complete :/ Anyways so stuff I want
		to get done: the enemy sprites, multiple establishments, maybe sound effects, shooting animation for the player, enemy types 
- version 0.5 - The enemy finally has a sprite. Multiple establishments have also been added so the player can now purchase ammo at the store,
		heal by buying a meal at a restaurant, or rob a liquer store for a chance of making money or losing health. Some level progression
		adjustments have also been made. So stuff I want to get done: establishment screens so they are not just white screens with black		
		text in fucking arial, maybe attack aniamtions, maybe sound effects
