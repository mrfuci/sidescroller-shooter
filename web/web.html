    <h2>Hello my name is William D. Brook</h2>
    <p>Well at least on the internet. As you may or may not know I am the author of William D. Brooks story.</p>
    <p>I always wanted to share Williams story so I decided to make this website. Here you can read the entire</p>
    <p>story. You can also read Williams backstory, check the time points, or read about Williams world. But</p>
    <p>that is not all, if you want you can also play the 2.5D shooter Im making called Bullet & Spite.</p>
    <p>At the time of writing the game is not finnished but it is in a playable state so if you dont mind</p>
    <p>janky games, feel free to try it. And that is all I have to say so goodbye.</p>
    <p>Sincerely: </p>
